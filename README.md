# Porte

Porte is a simple portfolio site built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) which aims to allow meaningful customization simply by updating a few files:
- `src/info.json`
- `public/images/background.jpg`
- `public/favicon.png`
- `public/images/logo.png`
- `src/texture.svg`

1. Add your info.
Update the file `./src/info.json` with your information. You might like using a tool I created called [DataDoer](https://datadoer.app/) to create your own json file.
2. Update images.
Replace images with your own files. I recommend using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for the favicon and logo. [Here's the Figma file for this site](https://www.figma.com/file/gpcVoQJhrOfwgkaENFv2mAlR/Porte?node-id=0%3A1).
- `public/images/background.jpg`
- `public/favicon.png`
- `public/images/logo.png`
3. Change background texture and styles.
You can replace `texture.svg` with your own custom texture our use one of Steve Schoger's beautiful patterns available at [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/). Make sure you 'Download unstyled SVG'.
5. Deploy!
I recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's dead simple, has incredible features and you can get started for free!
6. GA tracking
You can add a GA tracking id as an environment variable for some basic Google Analytics. I am a total GA noob so I'm not even sure this works :(
`REACT_APP_GA_ID`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
