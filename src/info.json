{"fullName":"Nathanael Raway","position":"Software Developer","location":"Minneapolis, MN","github":"n7l","bio":"My love for programming started when I was a kid writing games in QuickBasic on Intel 3/486 machines. This hobby began to transition into a career when I started working professionally in 2013 on a Python Django website. Since then I have had the privilege of working on many projects, giving me the opportunity to learn a wide range of technologies and tools. I am always excited to grow deeper in my understanding or widen my knowledge by learning something new.","tags":["Developer","Musician","Human","Learner"],"boxes":[{"title":"Albums","tag":"Musician","paragraph":"I can be heard on these albums","items":["Cedar - Human Nature","Cedar - Siren","Cedar - esc"]},{"title":"Skills","tag":"Developer","paragraph":"I have particular and recent experience with the following technologies","items":["JavaScript / JQuery / React / AngularJS","PHP / Symfony","Python / Flask","C# / .NET / .NET Core","BASH / Lua","MySQL / Redis","AWS / Docker / Flynn"]},{"title":"Tools","tag":"Developer","paragraph":"I use these tools to get things done","items":["Things 3","Sublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com/buy?v=3.0","Vim bindings (and vim too)","Hammerspoon","Spectacle","Docker","JetBrains","Git - here's my (git config file)[https://gist.github.com/sunfarm/1856087ce8add0bc0cd65d17d7101f21]","tmux/tmuxilator - here's my config !! put on github !!"]},{"title":"Education","tag":"Developer","paragraph":"I think this is a good point to be upfront that I don't have a CS degree. While I don't wish to undervalue such degrees and have considered returning to school, in my experience the day-to-day skills required for this work are not imparted by such degrees and esoteric knowledge can be studied and learned in context much more easily than in a theoretical academic setting. I am routinely baffled by the things that people DON'T learn in such programs. Most importantly, knowledge in this industry is easily available online and in excellent books and reading a text is a lot more meaningful when you're actually doing real work. If you disagree, no problem. You can probably grab another cup of coffee and move on to another prospect.","items":[{"where":"University of Minnesota","what":"School of Music (2011-2013)"},{"where":"University of Minnesota","what":"Computer Science (2010-2011)"},{"where":"Inver Hills Community College","what":"Associate of Arts (2007-2009)"}]},{"title":"Books","paragraph":"I highly recommend these books for the wisdom or knowledge they impart or thoughts they provoke.","items":[{"title":"Getting Things Done","authors":"David Allen"},{"title":"Ordinary Men","authors":"Christopher R.
