    "bio": "My love for programming started when I was a kid writing games in QuickBasic on Intel 3/486 machines. This hobby began to transition into a career when I started working professionally in 2013 on a Python Django website. Since then I have had the privilege of working on many projects, giving me the opportunity to learn a wide range of technologies and tools. I am always excited to grow deeper in my understanding or widen my knowledge by learning something new.",

While I don't wish to undervalue such degrees and may pursue such a degree at some point, in my experience the day-to-day skills required for what I do are not imparted by such degrees and esoteric knowledge can be studied and learned in context much more easily than in the more abstract academic setting. I am routinely baffled by the things that people DON'T learn in such programs. Most importantly, knowledge in this industry is easily available online and in excellent books and reading a text is a lot more meaningful when you're actually doing real work. If you disagree, no problem. You can probably grab another cup of coffee and move on to another prospect.",
