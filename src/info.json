    "bio": "My love for programming started when I was a kid writing games in QuickBasic on Intel 3/486 machines. This hobby began to transition into a career when I started working professionally in 2013 on a Python Django website. Since then I have had the privilege of working on many projects, giving me the opportunity to learn a wide range of technologies and tools. I am always excited to grow deeper in my understanding or widen my knowledge by learning something new.",

One of my weekly habits is to 'Get an idea out' which means taking an idea from my list of ideas that I have been accumulating over the years and put it into the world in some way. Sometimes this means creating a project on Github with some basic functionality, but other ideas are more abstract so I need a platform for releasing those ideas. This will be that platform for now.",
